Welcome to Pyramid text editor, the text editor created by Luke Wilkinson, Sven-Erik Weiss, Benjamin Trollope and Kathryn Reeve  This is a txt and rtf text editor that incorporates a number of useful features. It is designed to be easy to use and simplistic, so that anyone can use it with ease and without many instructions, if any are at all needed.  
 A quick overview:
 This text editor can create, open, save and print documents.
It has multiple editing and formatting functions, as well as some quirky yet useful review functions like a character counter and a function that even analyses your typing rate per minute! 
To put the cherry on top, Pyramid text editor has a built in web browser to allow you to search those little things straight from the text editor itself, to help you save time swapping through those pesky applications.
